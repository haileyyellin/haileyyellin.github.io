                <h2>1900s</h2>
                <p class="indent">A program built on excellence, beginning in 1904 known as the Old Liners in the
                    Southern Conference,
                    Maryland faced their future ACC rivals: North Carolina, Virginia, and Duke. In the early 1930s, the
                    team adopted the modern nickname, the Terrapins. In 1953, the Terps joined the ACC under their new
                    head coach Bud Millikan. Within four seasons, the Terps took control of the ACC and won the
                    tournament.
                </p>
                <p class="indent">
                    Fast forward to 1969, the team hired Charles “Lefty” Driesell. Driesell boldly claimed he wanted to
                    make Maryland the “UCLA of the East,” leading Maryland to 8 NCAA tournament appearances, an NIT
                    championship, two ACC regular-season championships, and one ACC tournament championship. Driesell
                    also recruited top players such as Len Elmore, John Lucas, and Maryland legend Len Bias.
                </p>
                <p class="indent">
                    Len Bias was an inspiration at the university and excelled tremendously, getting drafted second
                    overall in1986. Sadly, two days later he passed away due to a drug overdose. His death impacted
                    Maryland, leaving a hole in Terp Nation’s hearts.

                <h2>Rise to the Top</h2>
                <p class="indent">The Terrapins began their climb to the top by hiring Gary Williams in 1989. By 1994
                    the team made it
                    to the Sweet 16 and in 2001 the team’s first Final Four appearance. On April 1st, 2002, Williams led
                    the Terps to their first NCAA Championship. Maryland defeated Indiana 64-52, and senior Juan Dixon
                    was named Most Outstanding Player. The Terps held the lead through the first half, but the Hoosiers
                    came back into the game during the second half, taking the lead at 9:53. Maryland stayed relentless
                    and pulled out a strong lead holding Indiana to 8 points in the last 10 minutes, while scoring 22.

                <h2>Gary Williams</h2>
                <p class="indent">Williams became a legend, as Terp fans still roar at the sound of his name. Now 77
                    years old, he had
                    a full career, serving as head coach at American, Boston College, and Ohio State before Maryland. In
                    2011 Williams announced his retirement, and Maryland named its floor Gary Williams Court.

                <p class="indent">Mark Turgeon took command of the team as they prepared to enter a whole new world –
                    the Big Ten
                    Conference. The team succeeded in expectations over the next few years thanks to sensational players
                    like Melo Trimble, Diamond Stone, Anthony Cowan Jr., Kevin Huerter, Bruno Fernando, and Jalen Smith.
                    Maryland was named Big Ten Regular-Season Conference Champions in 2020, but just two seasons later
                    Turgeon and the Terps parted ways.
                </p>
                <p class="indent">
                    The athletic department announced on March 21st, that Kevin Willard, head coach from Seton Hall,
                    will be the new coach of the Terps. Willard has said this position is an honor and promises to build
                    winners, “I can promise Terp Nation we will work to make them proud of this basketball team as we
                    build winners.”
