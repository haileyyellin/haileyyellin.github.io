                <br>
                <p>40 cloves garlic chicken. Just writing those words I can smell the aroma that is still lingering in
                    my house.
                    This classic rustic French dish is generously rich in flavor. An oldie but super yummy recipe that
                    somehow is not
                    gracing our tables as much.
                <br>
                    I slightly made a change and from 40 cloves of garlic, I added at least 70 garlic cloves. Do not,
                    however, let the
                    quantities of garlic intimidate you. Once you have them in the oven they will lose the bite and keep
                    the mellow
                    sweetness. Combined with the extra dry white vermouth. you have a combination that will burst into
                    your mouth with
                    flavor.
                <br>
                    Provencal origins, southern France, this dish is so easy to make. It was introduced to this country
                    back in the
                    late 1960 and early 1970 by the great American chef James Beard.

                    The perfect fall comfort food.</p>

                <h2> Ingredients </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 4 pounds chicken cut into 8 pieces</li>
                    <li>salt and pepper</li>
                    <li>40 garlic cloves, peeled and hardcore end removed</li>
                    <li>½ cup extra dry vermouth</li>
                    <li>¾ cup chicken broth</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon</li>
                </ul>
                <h2> Preparations </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat oven to 350F</li>
                    <li>Heat oil in a 6 quarts Dutch oven pot over medium-high heat. Season the chicken generously with
                        salt and
                        pepper, all sides. Add to pot and cook undisturbed until skin is golden brown, and you can turn
                        the pieces over
                        with no difficulties. Turn only once.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the chicken to a baking dish, 8”x8” dish, set aside.</li>
                    <li>Add garlic to the pot and cook until browned in some spots, about 5 minutes. Add vermouth and
                        cook, scraping
                        the bottom of the pot, until slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Add the chicken stock and bring
                        it to a boil.
                        Transfer half the garlic cloves to the baking dish. Mash the remaining garlic cloves into stock
                        and pour over
                        the chicken.</li>
                    <li>Bake until glazed and tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Garnish with tarragon and serve.</li>
